# 1. Getting Started

First, let's load the data, which contains information on 1388 births. We would like to 
know whether smoking affects birthweight. After loading the dataset, we will get an overview
of what it contains using <code>describe</code> and summarize the variables to view their 
distributions and check for potential problems. We'll also run a quick check on missingness
using the user-written <code>mdescribe</code> command. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
use "${rawdatapath}birthweight.dta", clear
describe
su
mdesc
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

The summary statistics do not review any abnomalities, and there don't appear to be miscoded
missing observations in any of the variables. There is 14% missingness in the **fathereduc** variable,
which we'll want to keep in mind. Mothereduc has 1 missing observation. 

Now that we have the variables loaded and gotten to know the data a bit, 
we can move on to creating macro containing the names of 8 variables from our dataset. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
glob selectvars "faminc fatheduc motheduc parity male white cigs bwght"
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

Next, we will create a "smoker" dummy variable equal to 1 if the mother smoked any positive
amount of cigarettes and 0 if she smoked none. The **cigs** variable did not have missingness, 
so we don't have to worry about how to coding missing values in our new variable. We'll also
add value and variable lables. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>> 
recode cigs (0=0) (1/max=1), gen(smoker)
lab def smoker_lab 0 "non-smoker" 1 "smoker"
lab val smoker smoker_lab 
lab var smoker "dummy: 1=mother smoked one or more cigarette; 0=mother smoked zero cigarettes"
<</dd_do>>
~~~~ 

Now we want to find the median of **faminc**. To do this, we can retrieve the 50th percentile 
value from the return list after running the <code>summarize</code> command with the <code>detail</code> option. 
We can then store the returned value of the median as a local macro if we wish. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
su faminc, d
loc median = `r(p50)'
di "`median'"
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

Finally, using our newly created local macro, we can create a new dummy variable for high income. We will set this variable
equal to one for observations with family income at or above the median of <<dd_display: `median'  >>. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
gen highinc = 0
replace highinc=1 if faminc >=`median'
lab def highinc_lab 0 "family income below median" 1 "family income at or above median"
lab val highinc highinc_lab
lab var highinc "dummy: 1=family income at or above median, 0=not"
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

# 2. Descriptive Statistics

In order to get an overview of certain summary statistics pertaining to the variables selected in our global above,
we can use <code>tabstat</code> and then specify which stats we want and that we want them as columns.

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
tabstat $selectvars, s(mean median sd n) c(s) format(%6.0g) 
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

## 2a. Findings from descriptive table

**What do you notice in this table that you might want to report to your reader/audience?**

A couple of things stand out when looking at our summary table. First, we see again here that we have substantial missingness
in **fatheduc** and one missing value in **motheduc**. It's also worth noting that our sample is very White (78.4%), which
could be an issue if we think the relationship between smoking and birthweight varies by race. 

## 2b. Differences between smokers and non-smokers 

**Are there substantial diﬀerences in the characteristics of smokers and smokers?**

Using the option <code>by()</code>, we can separate our table into smokers and non-smokers. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
tabstat $selectvars, s(mean median sd n) c(s) format(%6.0g) by(smoker) nototal longstub
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

A quick overview of these results tells us that smokers appear, on average, to have lower family income, lower education
levels for both parents, and lower birthweights for their children.  

## 2c. Evidence of a causal effect? 

**Based on these results, would you feel comfortable calling the raw (unadjusted) diﬀerences in 
birthweight the “causal eﬀect of smoking”? Why or why not?**

Although average birthweight for the children of smokers appears to be lower than for non-smokers, I would not 
feel comfortable calling this a causal effect. First, without testing the difference in means we don't know that 
average smoker and non-smoker birthweights are statistically significantly different. Second, even if they are, there 
may be bias associated with unobserved or observed variables which, once accounted for, would erase the difference 
in birthweights between the two groups. 

## 2d. Smoker and income crosstab

**What would you conclude from a crosstab of the smoker dummy and the high-income dummy?**

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
tab smoker highinc, row nof  nol 
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

We can conclude from this crosstab that high-income observations are less likely to be smokers. 68% of lower-income
observations are smokers, whereas only 32% of high-income observations are smokers. 

# 3. Graphs

## 3a. Distibution of cigarettes smoked 

In order to view the distribution of the number of cigarettes smoked, we will create a histogram of the **cigs** variable. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
hist cigs, ///
	freq normal xtit("Number of Cigarettes Smoked") ///
	title("Histogram of Daily Cigarettes Smoked While Pregnant") ///
	saving("hist1.svg", replace)
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

<<dd_graph: sav("hist1.svg") replace height(400)>>

**What observations do you have for this distribution?**

As we can see, simply creating a histogram for the **cigs** variable creates a rather unhelpful graph since
the large number of "zeros" corresponding to non-smokers makes scale on the y-axis so large that the 
bins for those who *do* smoke are barely visible. We will therefore omit non-smoker observations in order to
better view the distribution of cigarette consumption among those who do smoke. So that we are sure to be clear about this 
decision, we will insert a note including the number of omitted observations. 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
hist cigs if cigs!=0, ///
	freq normal xtit("Number of Cigarettes Smoked") ///
	title("Histogram of Daily Cigarettes Smoked While Pregnant") ///
	note("Note: Non-smokers omitted from figure (N=1,176)") ///
	saving("hist2.svg", replace)
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

<<dd_graph: sav("hist2.svg") replace height(400)>>

## 3b. Distribution of parity

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
hist parity, ///
	freq normal xtit("Birth Order of Child") ///
	title("Histogram of Child Birth Order") ///
	saving("hist3.svg", replace)
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

<<dd_graph: sav("hist3.svg") replace height(400)>>

## 3c. Compare education distribution for smoking and non-smoking mothers.

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
hist motheduc if smoker==0, ///
	normal xtit("Years of Education") ///
	title("Non-Smokers") ///
	xlab(0(5)20) ///
	name(hist4, replace) 

hist motheduc if smoker==1, ///
	normal xtit("Years of Education") ///
	ytit("") ///
	xlab(0(5)20) ///
	title("Non-Smokers") ///
	name(hist5, replace) 
graph combine hist4 hist5, ///
	title("Histograms of Mother's Education Level") ///
	saving("hist4.svg", replace)
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

<<dd_graph: sav("hist4.svg") replace height(400)>>

**What diﬀerences, if any, do you notice in these two distributions?**

## 3d. Scatterplot of birthweight on cigarettes smoked 

~~~~
<<dd_do>>
twoway ///
	(scatter bwght cigs) ///
	(lfit bwght cigs), ///
	xtit("Cigarettes Smoked per Day") ytit("Birthweight in Ounces") ///
	title("Scatterplot of Birthweight on Daily Cigarettes Smoked") ///
	legend(off) ///
	saving("scatter.svg", replace)
<</dd_do>>
~~~~

<<dd_graph: sav("scatter.svg") replace height(400)>>

**Before running any regressions, what do you notice about these data?**
